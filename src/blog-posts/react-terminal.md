# Building a Terminal Portfolio in React

I decided to create this terminal-style portfolio to showcase my work in a unique way.
The project uses React and features tab completion, command history, and file system simulation.

## Key features implemented:
- Command parsing and execution
- Tab completion system
- File system simulation
- Interactive demos
