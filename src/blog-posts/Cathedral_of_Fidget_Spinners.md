#### Cathedral of Fidget Spinners: How Low Stakes Innovation Absorbs Disruptive Energy
###### Or: Why the 21st Century Produces Infinite Trinkets and No Moon Landings

The paradox of progress
In 1969, humans landed on the moon with a computer less powerful than my toaster. In 2023, we carry supercomputers in our pockets -- mostly to argue on X and watch cute kitten videos. The 21st century is a carnival of *micro-innovation*: faster gadgets, sleeker apps, fidget spinners, and glowing funko-pops. Yet where are the mars colonies? The cure for aging? Fusion reactors? Embryonic Selection?

We live in an age of infinite *optimisation* and *finite ambition*. The problem isn't a lack of genius, it is that the incentive structure have turned Breadth-First Search orientated, skimming the surface of progress while being depth-starved.

Bread and Circuses 2.0: Attention Economy
Ancient Rome pacified the passes with *panem et circenses*. Today's pacifiers are subtler; The Trinket Industrial Complex being fidget spinners and tiktok filters.
App-ification of Existence, software updates that add... a new emoji skin tone while Siri remains hamstrung.
Viral pseudo-junk food, content algorithms that turn human attention into a slurry of reaction videos and listicles.

This is not evil, they're by-products of a system that rewards low-risk, high-engagement BFS tinkering. Like Roman emperors, tech CEOs have learned that profitable populaces are a distracted one.

The Monster of the Marginal Gain
Modern structures optimise for economies of scale, the next earnings call, breeding a culture of BFS.
Micro-iterations happen to produce the 16th iphone, with a now thinner bezel! Precision Vaporware produces Metaverses that exist only in press releases and don't sell (vision pro, although personally I would like one). 

Scale over Soul
Uber for X, AirBnB for Y, ChatGPT wrapper for Z.
These are BFS innovations, small, safe, and correlated. They exploit known demand curves rather than explore unmapped frontiers. Venture capital floods into apps that 'disrupt' laundry, add complexity to food delivery, while embryonic selection start-ups beg for crumbs.

Why is this? **Risk Asymmetry**, a 10% improvement on an existing product (BFS) has predictable returns. A moonshot (DFS like ChatGPT, Oculus, SpaceX) might net glory -- or bankruptcy when first conceived. As Peter Thiel let us know, 'We wanted flying cars and all we got was 140 characters'

There is an opportunity cost to trinkets, every engineer tweaking Instagram's ad algorithm is **not** working on carbon capture. Every designer perfecting sneaker colourways is not reimagining city planning. This is the innovator's tragedy.

There is an attention graveyard, the average person spends more than a few hours a day on apps, I believe VR gaming attracted a few billion in VC funding in 2022, while fusion drew a few hundred million (possible this has changed). The worst part, even geniuses get sucked into triviality. Einstein, born today, might be working in financial markets and rugging crypto coins on the weekends. There is a conflation between *motion* (activity) with *momentum* (direction).

But Trinkets **ARE** Progress!
"Incremental gains add up!" True -- antibiotics improved via iteration, however originally they were a DFS breakthrough first.
"Markets reflect human desire!" Yes, and humans desire dopamine. Should we outsource progress to lizard brain casino-chasing incentives.

Rebuilding the Cathedral
Drastically better tax incentives, or even no tax... for extremely long term R&D and deep tech considerations.
A cultural rebranding making DFS sexy like it used to be, Edison would be less famous than Kim Kardashian.
Governments need to gamble and refresh long term infrastructure capabilities, they should revive DARPA-style moonshot agencies. China's investing in Nuclear, while Germany is coal. Stop optimising bingeable TV.
You can personally make a difference, stop watching TV and read instead, support "boring" industries like nuclear or materials science. Encourage your kids with science fiction and not Fortnite.
