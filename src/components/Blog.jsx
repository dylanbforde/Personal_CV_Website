      <h2>Building a Terminal Portfolio in React</h2>
      <p>I decided to create this terminal-style portfolio to showcase my work in a unique way.
         The project uses React and features tab completion, command history, and file system simulation.</p>
      <p>Key features implemented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Command parsing and execution</li>
        <li>Tab completion system</li>
        <li>File system simulation</li>
        <li>Interactive demos</li>
